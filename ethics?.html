        <h1>My personal reasoning.</h1>
        <p>I operate on a few simple principles.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>do no harm.</li>
            <li>respect autonomy</li>
            <li>agknowlage the impact of your actions</li>
            <li>radical acceptance</li>
        </ul>
        <p>     To do no harm is the basis of the hippocratic oath. I've never really taken an oath. But this one seems good.</p>
        <p>     To not go out with intention to hurt, is the baseline of decency.</p>
        <p>     Each living thing has a right to life.</p>
        <p>     Doesn't mater if it's a swamp, a jewish man, or an elderly dog.</p>
        <p>     Every living thing has a right to autonomy. To shape its future as it likes. A right to live and thrive.</p>
        <p>     We live in a web. Every action is connected.</p>
        <p>     Every action has a consiquence.</p>
        <p>     We need to acknoladge our consiquences. Beings died to feed you. People were hurt because of your words.</p>
        <p>     And lastly, radical acceptance.</p>
        <p>     If you cannot change it, why worry?</p>
